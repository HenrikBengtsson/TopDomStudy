Version: 0.0.0-9017 [2019-12-17]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Clarified textual annotations in the overlap-score profile plots.

 * Added human HAP1 HiC read-pair data for Chromosomes 23-25.

BUG FIXES:

 * Package did not handle chromosomes 23-25.
 
 
Version: 0.0.0-9016 [2019-12-05]

NEW FEATURES:

 * sample_partitions_similar_weights_by_half(..., fraction = 1/2) will return
   the two parts as-is, i.e. no downsampling is performed when fraction == 1/2.
 
BUG FIXES:

 * sample_partitions_by_cells_by_half(..., fraction) would return a test set
   where 'fraction' of the *cells* were downsampled instead of the *reads*.
   Now it is asserted that the sizes of the returned read-pair index sets are
   within the requested tolerance of the 50% reference and 'fraction'.
 
 * split_by_celltype_chromosome() required more than one chromosomes.


Version: 0.0.0-9015 [2019-10-29]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Add gg_overlap_score_summary_vs_bin_size() with example.

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Add vignettes on 'Data Preprocessing', 'TopDom Overlap Score Summaries',
   and 'Overview of the Ramani Data Set'.
 

Version: 0.0.0-9014 [2019-09-24]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Add compile_by_organism() for filtering and compiling Ramain et al. (2017)
   data by organism.  Added example script as well.
 
 * Add split_by_celltype() for splitting compiled data by celltype.  Added
   example script as well.
 
 * Add split_by_celltype_chromosome() for splitting compiled data by celltype
   and intra chromosomes.  Added example script as well.
 

Version: 0.0.0-9012 [2019-07-03]

BUG FIXES:

 * Package would give an error if the 'progressr' package was not available.
   Now it falls back to a dummy progressor function that voids all updates.
 

Version: 0.0.0-9011 [2019-06-18]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Add support for progress updates.

BUG FIXES:

 * gg_overlap_score_summary_vs_fraction() gave empty 'estimator' labels
   in the plot and empty tags in the image file name.


Version: 0.0.0-9010 [2019-06-18]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now using tibble data frames for briefer output when printed.

 * gg_overlap_score_summary_vs_fraction() gained argument 'skip'.  When
   skip=TRUE, already produced image files will not be regenerated.


Version: 0.0.0-9009 [2019-05-30]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added gg_overlap_score_summary_vs_fraction()


Version: 0.0.0-9008 [2019-05-15]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * overlap_score_summary_vs_nnn() functions now parallelize over fewer layers.

 * Package now imports ggplot2.

NEW FEATURES:

 * Add overlap_score_summary_grid().
   
 * Now overlap_score_summary_vs_bin_size() supports domain_length="ref_len_iqr".

 * Add previously standalone R and PBS scripts to the package bin/ folder, i.e.
   system.file("bin", package = "TopDomStudy")

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * TESTS: Add package test for overlap_score_summary_grid().

 * TESTS: overlap_score_summary_vs_bin_size() was never tested due to a typo.

BUG FIXES:

 * overlap_score_summary_nnn() functions did not respect 'verbose' argument.
 

Version: 0.0.0-9007 [2019-05-01]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Intermediate results written by overlap_score_summary_vs_bin_size() to
   overlapScoreSummary/ are now reused by overlap_score_summary_vs_bin_size(),
   and vice verse.  This was not the case previously because the two functions
   used different pathname templates.


Version: 0.0.0-9006 [2019-04-30]

NEW FEATURES:
 
 * Add overlap_score_summary_vs_bin_size() and overlap_score_summary_vs_fraction().
   Extracted from "work" R scripts with the same name.


Version: 0.0.0-9005 [2019-04-09]

NEW FEATURES:

 * overlap_scores_partitions() gained argument 'window.size'.


Version: 0.0.0-9004 [2019-04-09]

 * ...


Version: 0.0.0-9003 [2019-03-??]

 * ...


Version: 0.0.0-9002 [2019-03-12]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Add support for domain-length filtering in overlap_score_summary().


Version: 0.0.0-9001 [2019-02-10]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Add support for weighted estimates for overlap_score_summary().


Version: 0.0.0-9000 [2018-12-18]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Moved existing scripts and functions into an R package.
